# ðŸ“š Course : Advanced Node and Express
Now it's time to take a deep dive into Node.js and Express.js by building a chat application with a sign-in system.

To implement the sign-in system safely, you'll need to learn about authentication. This is the act of verifying the identity of a person or process.

In this course, you'll learn how to use Passport to manage authentication, Pug to create reusable templates for quickly building the front end, and web sockets for real-time communication between the clients and server.
